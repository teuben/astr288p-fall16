Lecture 9: ORBITS and ODE's
===========================


## Survey

During break students are encouraged to fill out a survey

## Last Week addenda

* n6503-case1 : n6503_rms.png produce several methods to estimate the RMS as function of channel.
* n6503-case1 : saving your results in a FITS file
* n6503-orbits: scipy.interpolate.interp2d


## New notebooks:

* **orbits-01** : computing orbits as an ODE
