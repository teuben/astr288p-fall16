Lecture 7:  ASTROPY
===================



## Last Week Exercise

### 1: cleanup repo

### 2: wrong1.py

### 3: even_minus_odd_sum(N)

### 4: d = mkdata(mean=10, rms=5, n=10000)

### 5: use fits header to get the freq or vel coordinate

WCS = World Coordinate System

## testing your modules in python

A new pure-python script was added to the ```notebooks``` directory to identify potential problems
before you start a notebook (although some of them are on purpose):

```
cd astr288p/notebooks
./testing.py
```

### Astronomical Data


* Images:  FITS files.  (a new file **ngc6503.cube.fits** was added to your astr288p/data directory)
  * ds9: http://ds9.si.edu/site/Download.html
  * ginga: https://ginga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
  
* Tables  (astropy http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/unified.html)
  * ascii tables
  * FITS tables
  * VO tables
* 



## Continuing notebooks:

* **n6503-case1** : analyzing the new ngc6503.cube.fits using astropy
* **n6503-case2** : analyzing the new ngc6503.cube.fits using radio-astro-tools (experimental)
* **n6503-orbits** : theoretical models what to expect of a galactic velocity field

## Other Interesting Notebooks:

*  GW150914 merging black hole : https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.html
