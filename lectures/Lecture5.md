Lecture 5:  PYTHON
==================


## Updating your *astr288p* repo

As always, update your git repo. After last weeks' work, you might see a problem now!
```
   cd ~/ASTR288P/astr288p      # make sure you are in one of the 'astr288p' directories
   git status                  # notice something was modified?
   git pull                    # warnings are possible here if there are conflicts
   git stash                   # those modified files are "stashed"
   git pull                    # now get the updates
   
```
