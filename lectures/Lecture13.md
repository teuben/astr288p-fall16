Lecture 13: PDE's and ODE's
===========================


## notebooks:


* **athena-01** : PDE's continuing - 
  plotting and overplotting solutions

* **orbits-01** : ODE's - after **In[12]** - Q3:
  what if the potential is not axisymmetric?  Did we design the data structure right to compare integration methods?
