Lecture 4:  PYTHON
==================


## Updating your *astr288p* repo

Always update your git repo for this class. New material is more than likely present every week.
```
   cd ~/ASTR288P/astr288p      # make sure you are in one of the 'astr288p' directories
   git status                  # first make  sure you don't have anything modified
   git pull                    # warnings are possible here if there are conflicts
```

## Python 

* python: the script interpreter

```
	python
```

	Normally never typed by the user, but python scripts normally start with
```
	 #! /usr/bin/env python
```

* ipython: interactive python
```
	ipython
	alias i=ipython
```	

* jupyter: web interface

```
	ipython notebook
	jupyter notebook
	
```	

Now watch your default browser opening a new tab. Navigave to your **astr288p/notebooks** folder, where
you should see some *ipynb* files.
