Instructor will guide students in their learning, with problems and
assignments being somewhat self-paced. Formal lectures will occur in some
sessions, but most time will be taken up by students working on programming
assigments. Instructor will be present for guidance and trouble-shooting. 
Student will have access to the computer lab (CSS 0224) 
when it is otherwise not in use. Contact instructor if access is needed.
