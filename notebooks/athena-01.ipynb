An in-depth discussion of MHD codes is beyond our current scope, but we have to recall that python is not always the best code to implement codes that need a large number of computations.  An example of a related problem that was solved in a notebook using python, is the heat equation using the Crank-Nickelson method, and is described [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/waltherg/notebooks/blob/master/2013-12-03-Crank_Nicolson.ipynb)."
